### APIs/Modules used
I used the [ipinfo.io](http://ipinfo.io) API to get location data when you create a post. Unfortunately, when running the server on your local machine, it will always give you an IP address of "::1", which you obviously can't get location info for. Because of this I just put in a default value for testing purposes.

To get the IP info, I used the REST-client ruby gem.

To enable markdown syntax usage in posts, I used the RedCarpet ruby gem.
